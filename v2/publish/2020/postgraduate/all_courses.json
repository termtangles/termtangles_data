The answer lies in the fact that resources are inevitably scarce and choices have to be made about their allocation. Health economics is about the optimisation of health relative to other activities and making choices to use resources in ways that improve health and service delivery within the limited resources available. Health economics can provide insight into questions like: \u00a0Which is the more effective method of increasing the uptake of health services: price-controls or subsidies?\u00a0How will the involvement of the private sector in the funding and delivery of health care affect access to it? What are the most cost-effective mechanisms for delivering essential medicines to those living in remote areas?\u00a0Are out of pocket payments for health care a regressive funding mechanism? How should doctors be paid?

Students will be challenged to consider: ways in which healthy ageing can be fostered; how health care systems can be better aligned to the care of older populations; long-term care models which reflect older-person-centred care; and the creation of enabling environments. The course is underpinned by the concepts of intrinsic capacity and functional ability. Students are offered an optimistic view of population ageing, and will be equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to take action to improve the health and wellbeing of older people.This course maintains an international focus and is relevant to high, middle and low income countries.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n", "title": "Contemporary Issues in Ageing", "contentTypeLabel": "Course", "urlMap": "/postgraduate/courses/2020/PHCM9617/", "implementationYear": 2020, "effectiveDate": "2020-01-01", "termOffering": ["Term 1"], "schoolName": "School of Public Health & Community Medicine", "facultyName": "Faculty of Medicine", "enrolmentRules": ["Prerequisite: Students who are not enrolled in a postgraduate program in the School of Public Health and Community Medicine will need to provide approval from their program authority and the approval of the course convenor to postgrad-sphcm@unsw.edu.au<br/><br/>"], "prerequisites": {}, "corequisites": {}, "exclusion": []}, {"code": "PHCM9622", "creditPoints": 6, "studyLevel": "Postgraduate", "keywords": ["public health and community medicine", "the global hiv pandemic", "preventing the spread of hiv", "support care and treatment for those living with hiv", "vulnerability stigma discrimination hiv", "governing hiv", "social and cultural aspects of the global hiv epidemic", "antiretroviral therapy", "living with hiv and health care workforce implications", "ideological  underpinnings of global regional and country responses to hiv"], "description": "<p><em><strong>This course is offered in two modes: either face to face (on-campus) and fully online.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>This course will examine the social, cultural and economic aspects of HIV worldwide.

Australia\u2019s economic competitors are moving rapidly into higher levels of digital innovation at the same time as our leading trade partners and neighbours in Asia have unmet demand for services in the digital economy. Inside Australia, the environment for decision-making on policy for the information age is operating on narrow pathways. The picture of our digital economy is one of falling competitiveness and only medium (to low) levels of innovation. New cyber threats and capabilities are emerging on the military and espionage scenes to which Australia must adapt and respond. But the country needs a digital age strategy for its civil sector before it can have a digital military strategy. The experience levels that key decision-makers have of the IT sector do not in many cases match the nature of the diverse problems. Perhaps the Defence organisation in Australia can take something of a lead to reverse this situation in the country as a whole. But it would need to recognise at the outset that the level of expertise in Australia in military applications in this field, as in many other countries, is low. We need new foreign allies in this field. The effort will need to be multi-national, multi-sector and private-public. In grappling with the large problems of national innovation strategies and national security issues, all actors have had to confront the social and legal impacts of advanced information technologies as well. The debate over privacy and metadata laws for security surveillance is just one example of the myriad ethical questions Australia has had to confront.

The fourth stage in the SMY addresses how a General Manager can respond to performance risks generated from a lack of external fit that might already exist or be likely to exist in the near future. The risk to external fit can come from any one of a number of sources: regulation, buyer power, technology, competitors, supplier power etc. When external fit is at risk it is likely that the business model will need to be reexamined and redefined, leading to transformational change. At the end of this stage, students will be able to: Recommend a transformation strategy for an organisation, Develop a plan for the implementation of transformational change, Evaluate and manage the risks associated with a proposed transformational change and Facilitate an organisation&#39;s ability to renew itself proactively through identifying and interpreting weak signals in both the external and internal environments.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the SMY explores four themes across all four courses: Critical Thinking, Entrepreneurship, Leadership and Decision Making.\u00a0</p>", "title": "Strategic Management 4", "contentTypeLabel": "Course", "urlMap": "/postgraduate/courses/2020/MNGT7494/", "implementationYear": 2020, "effectiveDate": "2020-01-01", "termOffering": [], "schoolName": "AGSM MBA Programs", "facultyName": "UNSW Business School", "enrolmentRules": [], "prerequisites": {}, "corequisites": {}, "exclusion": []}, {"code": "MNGT7495", "creditPoints": 12, "studyLevel": "Postgraduate", "keywords": ["management", "strategic leadership", "leadership"], "description": "<p>This course explores the complexity of strategic leadership and will give you tools and a mindset to effectively work in the challenging and rewarding environment in which senior executives lead.

You will gain these skills through engaging in activities and assessments that help you develop in the areas of identifying, evaluating and planning the implementation of value-creating growth options. We will draw on your experiences, written case studies, published articles, book chapters, videos, podcasts, a live case study and simulations to help build your skills in these areas.</p>\n\n<p>You will analyse a range of different growth options available to managers. Two primary paths for organisational growth involve: (a) expanding into new products/services and\u00a0(b) expanding into new markets (i.e. geographic locations and customer segments).</p>\n\n<p>Another important dimension to consider, together with the two\u00a0primary paths,\u00a0is resources. Organisations can be viewed as bundles of resources. Examples of resources are brand names, in-house knowledge of technology, skilled personnel, trade contracts, machinery, capital, efficient procedures, etc. As we will explore in the course, analysing the organisation from the resource perspective can help to identify new strategic growth options. Note that our use of the term &#39;Resources&#39; includes capabilities and management systems.</p>\n\n<p>Also, for each of the two expansion paths, there are several alternative vehicles for growth.\u00a0An organisation can elect to grow organically by expanding the market share of its current business, innovating into new products/services, or opening greenfield sites in new geographic locations. Alternatively, an organisation may decide to grow through merger or acquisition. Finally, strategic partnerships or alliances represent yet another vehicle for growth arranged through long-term contracts/licences, equity stakes or joint ventures (JVs) between separate organisations. Many organisations employ all of these vehicles in their growth strategies.</p>\n\n<p>In the course, we will discuss each of these paths and vehicles for growing organisations and evaluate options for growth in a variety of sectors and contexts. However, identifying attractive growth options does not automatically translate into success. Managers also need to successfully implement a growth strategy to make it work. An integrated growth strategy includes a plan for obtaining the capabilities needed to succeed in each growth option, the timing and phasing of each step involved to expand the organisation, and aligning the structure and systems for managing organisational growth.</p>\n\n<p>A very important aspect of implementing an effective growth strategy entails identifying and thinking through the risks involved. There are substantial risks associated with growth strategies. A great deal of research shows\u00a0that the expected economic benefits of diversifying into new products/services are often not captured, and that many mergers and acquisitions are failures. Similarly, international expansion often falls short of delivering the expected returns. However, this has not stopped managers from engaging in widespread diversification, implementing mergers and acquisitions, or expanding internationally in attmpts to fuel company growth.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the medium and large Australian companies we read about in the business press every day have expanded beyond a single product or single market, and many have been involved in a merger or acquisition. In the course we will discuss how to limit risk by identifying growth options that leverage the existing strengths of the organisation, how to evaluate whether an organisation is the natural or best owner of a given business, and how to avoid paying too much for an acquisition.</p>\n", "title": "Growth", "contentTypeLabel": "Course", "urlMap": "/postgraduate/courses/2020/MNGT7497/", "implementationYear": 2020, "effectiveDate": "2020-01-01", "termOffering": ["Summer Term", "Term 2", "Term 3"], "schoolName": "AGSM MBA Programs", "facultyName": "UNSW Business School", "enrolmentRules": [], "prerequisites": {}, "corequisites": {}, "exclusion": []}, {"code": "MNGT7498", "creditPoints": 12, "studyLevel": "Postgraduate", "keywords": ["management", "transformation", "executive agenda 4"], "description": "<p>Transformation means dealing with the challenges of change and uncertainty,\u00a0sensing, seizing and transforming.

The value generating potential of such organisations is attributed to resources, and competencies in managing these resources, that the traditional accounting system is often both unable and unwilling to represent in explicit financial terms. Based on the premise that long term sustainable value creation is best achieved from collaborative organisational practices and transparency among all stakeholders, this course aims to identify these &#34;intangible resources&#34; and to examine their role in achieving superior financial performance. The course examines how intangible assets are treated from a financial accounting perspective given International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and offers a critical understanding of measurement and auditing challenges. Additionally, the course incorporates performance measurement frameworks that seek to represent intangible resources often not captured within conventional\u00a0accounting systems (for example, the Balanced Scorecard and other methodologies that seek to meaningfully measure and evaluate intangibles).

It is aimed at creating long-lasting and profitable relationships with individual customers - in both B2B and B2C contexts. Developments in technology have allowed organizations to look at their customers as individuals and to gather, store and analyse customer-based information. An outcome is an increase in the use of direct marketing techniques such as those for designing and managing consumer databases and customer service centres. Topics include: CRM strategy development; value creation through CRM; multichannel integration; information and technology management; and CRM performance assessment.

Through a consideration of the relationships between the principal institutions of government under Australian Constitutions \u2013 parliaments, the executive and the courts \u2013 it introduces students to key values and constructs underpinning the Australian legal system, including the significance, and limits, of conceptions of the \u2018rule of law\u2019. The course explores the nature of the common law and common law reasoning, with a particular emphasis on the circumstances of the adoption of the common law in the Australian states, the common law\u2019s role in facilitating dispossession, and the ongoing impact of colonisation for Indigenous people in Australia. It also explores the processes by which cases are decided by judges, introducing some theoretical frameworks that have been used to analyse law and legal decision making. The roles of judges, practising lawyers and other personnel in the court system are also considered, with an emphasis on the need for the development of professional identities and resilience, as well as the role of lawyers in promoting just outcomes. Legal research methods and legal citation are taught via the Legal Research and Writing (Stage 1) tutorials attached to JURD7152.</p>\n\n<p>Main Topics covered:</p>\n\n<ul><li>The Australian Legal System in Action</li><li>From Case Law to Common Law: Legal Reasoning, the Doctrine of Precedent and Legal Problem Solving</li><li>Introduction to Statutory Interpretation</li><li>The relationship between Law and Equity</li><li>Common Law Theory and Judicial Independence</li><li>Rule of Law, Colonial History, and the Separation of Powers</li><li>The Reception of English Law</li><li>The Impact of Dispossession on Indigenous People</li><li>Social Change and Judicial Decision Making</li><li>Reimagining Law and Justice</li><li>Resilience and Developing a Professional Identity</li><li>Introduction to Primary and Secondary Legal Research methods</li><li>Introduction to research for legal problem solving and policy scenarios</li><li>Legal Citation</li></ul>\n", "title": "Introducing Law and Justice", "contentTypeLabel": "Course", "urlMap": "/postgraduate/courses/2020/JURD7152/", "implementationYear": 2020, "effectiveDate": "2020-01-01", "termOffering": ["Term 1", "Term 2", "Term 3"], "schoolName": "N/A", "facultyName": "Faculty of Law", "enrolmentRules": ["Prerequisite: Academic Program must be 9150.<br/><br/>"], "prerequisites": {}, "corequisites": {}, "exclusion": []}, {"code": "JURD7160", "creditPoints": 6, "studyLevel": "Postgraduate", "keywords": ["juris doctor", "administrative law"], "description": "<p>Administrative Law is a compulsory course that builds on what you will have already learnt in Public Law (JURD7140).

The early social theories differed markedly from each other, but they agreed upon one thing: the modern west was developing in ways and at a pace which were unprecedented in European history, and unparalleled anywhere else in this world. This so-called \u201cgreat transformation\u201d formed the context and topic of classical social theory. It prompted questions which had not been considered as urgently or directly before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Among these are large questions about how people can and should be expected to behave, how increasingly large and complex societies \u201chang together\u201d; and what differentiates one form of society and legal order from another. Typically the law presupposes that it has the answers to such questions. But in fact these questions have a form and structure that are not amenable to traditional legal analysis: a fact which renders lawyers, who are exercising their own specialised techniques, not especially expert in answering them. Listed immediately below are some of the questions that engaged the attention of the classic founders of modern social theory and which will be covered in the course.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1. What social functions do legal systems in general play, and what functions do specific types of legal systems play?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Is law necessary (or even beneficial) for orderly social life, or is it better to dispense with it?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>3.

Why do we do these things? Is it because we want to do the \u201cright\u201d thing? Or simply because it is the law? Put differently: why do humans need and create laws and what do we aim to accomplish through law?</p>\n\n<p>Within the Western tradition, law often reflects religious values (for example, those of the Ten Commandments) while Roman Law established the first sophisticated \u201crule of law\u201d. From the authoritarian commands of Kings, Queens or dictators to the promise of \u201csocial contracts\u201d and modern deliberative democracy, law has developed into a highly complex tool to organize the way we live together. It is now perceived as safe-guarding our freedom and equality, as solidifying the power of economic and political elites, empowering minorities to fight racism and discrimination, a tool to control property and territory, and organize global flows of people and products. Law is, most importantly, also our main instrument to overcome violence and injustice, punish, settle conflicts and create reconciliation.</p>\n\n<p>The course examines all these aspects in a historical, analytical and critical manner by showcasing different legal-philosophical positions, mainly taken from the Western jurisprudential canon while also looking at Indigenous and Asian perspectives. Some of the theories we engage with are: Natural Law, Legal Positivism, Legal Hermeneutics, Legal Realism, Feminist Jurisprudence, Legal Pluralism, Legal Pragmatism. In addition, the course engages with the wider framework of law: moral and political philosophy. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In sum, Legal Theory reflects on fundamental problems of modern law from a legal, moral and political perspective and provides students with a deeper understanding of the presuppositions that inform law, legal institutions and their own future professional practices. Its ultimate goal is to clarify what it means to be \u2018before the law\u2019 and if, how and where \u2018law meets justice\u2019.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n", "title": "Legal Theory", "contentTypeLabel": "Course", "urlMap": "/postgraduate/courses/2020/JURD7223/", "implementationYear": 2020, "effectiveDate": "2020-01-01", "termOffering": ["Term 1", "Term 2", "Term 3"], "schoolName": "N/A", "facultyName": "Faculty of Law", "enrolmentRules": ["Pre-requisite: 24 UOC completed in LLB courses or 24 UOC completed in Juris Doctor courses.

This is because, in comparison with civilian legal systems, Australia (1987) and England and Wales (1991) were both slow to recognise unjust enrichment as a source of rights and duties within the law of obligations.

Why do we do these things? Is it because we want to do the \u201cright\u201d thing? Or simply because it is the law? Put differently: why do humans need and create laws and what do we aim to accomplish through law?</p>\n\n<p>Within the Western tradition, law often reflects religious values (for example, those of the Ten Commandments) while Roman Law established the first sophisticated \u201crule of law\u201d. From the authoritarian commands of Kings, Queens or dictators to the promise of \u201csocial contracts\u201d and modern deliberative democracy, law has developed into a highly complex tool to organize the way we live together. It is now perceived as safe-guarding our freedom and equality, as solidifying the power of economic and political elites, empowering minorities to fight racism and discrimination, a tool to control property and territory, and organize global flows of people and products. Law is, most importantly, also our main instrument to overcome violence and injustice, punish, settle conflicts and create reconciliation.</p>\n\n<p>The course examines all these aspects in a historical, analytical and critical manner by showcasing different legal-philosophical positions, mainly taken from the Western jurisprudential canon while also looking at Indigenous and Asian perspectives. Some of the theories we engage with are: Natural Law, Legal Positivism, Legal Hermeneutics, Legal Realism, Feminist Jurisprudence, Legal Pluralism, Legal Pragmatism. In addition, the course engages with the wider framework of law: moral and political philosophy. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In sum, Legal Theory reflects on fundamental problems of modern law from a legal, moral and political perspective and provides students with a deeper understanding of the presuppositions that inform law, legal institutions and their own future professional practices. Its ultimate goal is to clarify what it means to be \u2018before the law\u2019 and if, how and where \u2018law meets justice\u2019.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n", "title": "Legal Theory", "contentTypeLabel": "Course", "urlMap": "/postgraduate/courses/2020/JURD7431/", "implementationYear": 2020, "effectiveDate": "2020-01-01", "termOffering": ["Term 1", "Term 2", "Term 3"], "schoolName": "N/A", "facultyName": "Faculty of Law", "enrolmentRules": ["72 UOC of JURD courses<br/><br/>"], "prerequisites": {}, "corequisites": {}, "exclusion": []}, {"code": "JURD7433", "creditPoints": 6, "studyLevel": "Postgraduate", "keywords": ["juris doctor", "privacy and the media"], "description": "<p>This course is concerned with the emerging law of privacy as it relates to the media (traditional mass media and newer electronic technologies of communication), and the intersection between privacy and freedom of speech.

Both law and biology are meaningful structures which define, diagnose, and create concepts of persons as &#34;nature&#34;, &#34;bodies&#34;, &#34;organism&#34;, &#34;groups&#34; or &#34;life&#34; (to name just a few). &#34;Law and Biology&#34; aims to provide a historical, analytical, and critical reflection on the legal implications of biological or biologized legalities.</p>\n<p>The unit complements other units offered at the law school such as Legal Theory, Law and Social Theory, and Theories of Law and Justice. Similar to these units, Law and Biology has an emphasis on theoretical and critical aspects of the topic and relates law to an interdisciplinary field of knowledge and legal practices. The unit also relates to units such as Law and Medical Health or Intellectual Property Law which connect law with the biomedical or biotechnological field. The main difference with the theory electives is that Law and Biology takes place in an entirely different context, the field of biology, and that its focus is on theorizing law in the contemporary world where biolegitimacy increasingly takes hold. The difference with the other units is that the Law and Biology unit does not focus on matters of litigation. Instead, it opens up a broader and theoretical horizon both in the ways law itself can be understood and how it is connected to biology and science as a method. This connection will be explained through historical, analytical and legal insights and will include reflections on the scientific and ethical questions this relation provokes in the contemporary legal system.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Students wishing to think about law \u201coutside the box&#34; and who are interested in developing a rich theoretical and interdisciplinary perspective on law combining insights from philosophy, biology, technology, sociology, neurology, psychology and ethics will surely enjoy this course.It is recommended that students have some knowledge in legal theory through having taken one of the legal theory prescribed electives before enrolling in this course.

Lawyers practice within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Citizens live, and the laws operate, in societies in which specific social arrangements, structures, roles, expectations and conceptions of what is possible and what is right, are widely held and shape our views about law and about society. Customarily, most of us think <em>within</em> these categories and arrangements, rather than <em>about</em> them.</p>\n<p>Theoretical investigation of those arrangements and understandings has to do with what underlies them. It is concerned to look beneath what we take for granted, to see what accounts for it, what its nature is, how it works and how it changes. <em>Social</em> theory is concerned to ask such questions about societies in which people live. Investigations about theories of law and society will lead us beyond our original and usually quite unreflectiveviews of what is important in law, what functions itplays, what it is for, whose interests it serves and how it serves them, what causes legal change and how important law is in society.

The early social theories differed markedly from each other, but they agreed upon one thing: the modern west was developing in ways and at a pace which were unprecedented in European history, and unparalleled anywhere else in this world. This so-called \u201cgreat transformation\u201d formed the context and topic of classical social theory. It prompted questions which had not been considered as urgently or directly before.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Among these are large questions about how people can and should be expected to behave, how increasingly large and complex societies \u201chang together\u201d; and what differentiates one form of society and legal order from another. Typically the law presupposes that it has the answers to such questions. But in fact these questions have a form and structure that are not amenable to traditional legal analysis: a fact which renders lawyers, who are exercising their own specialised techniques, not especially expert in answering them. Listed immediately below are some of the questions that engaged the attention of the classic founders of modern social theory and which will be covered in the course.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1.

The course develops an understanding of systems thinking and the theory of how to address complex social issues or \u2018wicked problems\u2019 through application of these tools. Key concepts are further explored of measuring and funding impact, scaling, leadership and collaboration. The course examines the trends and drivers reshaping the dynamics of social impact and the changing role of government from provider to enabler. The course reviews changes in the social purpose ecosystem, including looking at business models for social change, the \u2018hybridity\u2019 of social enterprises and social businesses, social procurement, social value creation, new forms of philanthropy and social impact investment.</p>\n\n<p>Through a focus on innovation and case studies, the course examines the ways in which individuals and organisations can contribute to developing new ways of collaborating by government, business and the social sector. It explores how system change is possible through these changes driven social innovation and concludes with a review of global trends and organisations that effect social change and impact. There is an emphasis on communication and application of the course concepts.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n", "title": "Social Impact", "contentTypeLabel": "Course", "urlMap": "/postgraduate/courses/2020/COMM5701/", "implementationYear": 2020, "effectiveDate": "2020-01-01", "termOffering": ["Term 1", "Term 2", "Term 3"], "schoolName": "N/A", "facultyName": "UNSW Business School", "enrolmentRules": [], "prerequisites": {}, "corequisites": {}, "exclusion": []}, {"code": "COMM5703", "creditPoints": 6, "studyLevel": "Postgraduate", "keywords": ["commerce", "social impact", "third sector; australian school of business", "social investment", "philanthropy", "fundraising"], "description": "<p>Major changes are reshaping the role of philanthropy both internationally and in the Australian context: global economic realignments, the privatisation of community services; new patterns of wealth distribution and of inter-generational wealth transfer; greater expectations of the role of corporate citizenship and of corporate philanthropy.

As a critical part of the design process the model expresses ideas and concepts in three dimensions with concern for materials, lighting, space and, nowadays, interactivity; in other words the model literally presents all of the components of a finished architecture. Traditionally architectural models have been hand-made which both reflected the building process of the time and a cultural longing by architects to be more directly involved in the production of their work (many architects design products, especially furniture, for the same reason). But for some time now architecture has been tending towards the assembly of factory made components; and, as can be seen across the world, factories tend towards automated machine-made production. It\u2019s worthwhile to point out at this stage that beautiful things are created in factories.

The course will situate the law in its broader context by exploring the social and practical as well as legal reality surrounding native title recognition, the interaction of native title holders with government and industry sectors and the pursuit of wider Indigenous aspirations in the post-<em>Mabo </em>era.</p>\n<p><strong>Main Topics</strong></p>\n<ul><li>From terra nullius to Mabo No 2</li><li>Getting a Native Title Act</li><li>Scoping the Act</li><li>Wik and the 1998 Amendment Act</li><li>Society, continuity and connection</li><li>Native title: characterisation and content</li><li>Extinguishment</li><li>Compensation</li><li>Preparing, pursuing and litigating native title claims</li><li>After the claim is over</li><li>Future acts</li><li>Agreement-making</li><li>Economic and social development and native title</li><li>Current law and policy reform debates</li><li>Evaluating native title and its significance.</li></ul>\n<ul></ul>", "title": "Native Title Law, Policy and Practice", "contentTypeLabel": "Course", "urlMap": "/postgraduate/courses/2020/LAWS8212/", "implementationYear": 2020, "effectiveDate": "2020-01-01", "termOffering": [], "schoolName": "N/A", "facultyName": "Faculty of Law", "enrolmentRules": ["Pre-requisite: Academic Program must be Academic Program must be 9200 or 9201 or 9211 or 9231 or 9220.<br/><br/>"], "prerequisites": {}, "corequisites": {}, "exclusion": ["JURD7812"]}, {"code": "LAWS8213", "creditPoints": 6, "studyLevel": "Postgraduate", "keywords": ["law", "legal concepts", "legal research", "legal writing", "legal studies", "legal interpretation"], "description": "<p>This course introduces students to the world of law, legal systems and legal scholarship.

The main objective of this course is to give managers a high-level overview of the fundamental concepts, main topics and problems in computer science and information technology and how they relate to business settings, and thus equip them to make better decisions regarding applications of technology, even if they are not technologists themselves. This course takes a top-down approach and emphasises high-level mastery of important concepts in computer science and information technology.

Product manager is increasingly becoming the job of choice for MBA students. Similarly, more and more industries, especially traditional service industries, are creating their own products to deliver more capabilities to their customers and require new capabilities from their managers. Being a product manager requires similar skills to a CEO, which combined with the perceived attractiveness of working in the tech industry, makes it an attractive career path for graduating MBA and management students.

By engaging in theoretical discourse and critically assessing selected theories students will gain deeper understanding of major theoretical developments in the IS discipline and their relevance and implications for practice. The seminar character of the course assumes active participation and contribution by the students.</p>", "title": "Theoretical Foundations of Information Systems", "contentTypeLabel": "Course", "urlMap": "/postgraduate/courses/2020/INFS5987/", "implementationYear": 2020, "effectiveDate": "2020-01-01", "termOffering": ["Term 1"], "schoolName": "School of Info Systems and Technology Management", "facultyName": "UNSW Business School", "enrolmentRules": ["Enrolled into one of the following Research Programs: 1521, 1545, 1561, 1535, 2585, 1540, 1525, 1550, 1605, 1532 or 1745 or 8409 or 8415 or stream ACCTYS8404<br/><br/>"], "prerequisites": {}, "corequisites": {}, "exclusion": []}, {"code": "INFS5993", "creditPoints": 6, "studyLevel": "Postgraduate", "keywords": ["information systems", "information systems management", "information technology management"], "description": "<p>This course involves creation and submission of a research report about an IS/IT management related topic of your choice.\u00a0 The report must demonstrate critical thought and exhibit a level of analysis appropriate to a Masters degree, and display a high level of professionalism and competence in presentation.<strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Enrolment Requirements: Head of school approval</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>", "title": "Special Topic in Information Systems and Technology Management", "contentTypeLabel": "Course", "urlMap": "/postgraduate/courses/2020/INFS5993/", "implementationYear": 2020, "effectiveDate": "2020-01-01", "termOffering": ["Term 1"], "schoolName": "School of Info Systems and Technology Management", "facultyName": "UNSW Business School", "enrolmentRules": [], "prerequisites": {}, "corequisites": {}, "exclusion": ["INFS5740"]}, {"code": "INFS5997", "creditPoints": 6, "studyLevel": "Postgraduate", "keywords": ["information systems", "information systems management", "enterprise systems and business design practicum", "operations management", "interorganisational systems - supply chain management"], "description": "<p>The Enterprise Systems and Business Design Practicum course is a capstone option for the Enterprise Systems and Business Design specialisation stream in the MCom program.\u00a0 This course provides an opportunity to integrate academic rigor with industry experience; to apply theory to solve real world problems, to make the learning experiential, to facilitate project-based learning, and to integrate scholarship with practice.
