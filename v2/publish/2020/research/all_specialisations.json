The stream will also serve art workers wishing to develop a research practice within their field (eg. education, administration/management, programming/curation, disability arts support, community arts, artist development, producing). Professional artists with an existing practice will develop writing and analytical skills within the course to support their careers in relation to both communications and creative development. An enhanced career in the fields mentioned is a possible outcome, or entry into these competitive fields with the advantage of skills in independent research and analysis.

You\u00a0will be well equipped to specialise as critics/reviewers and arts journalists, develop niche curatorial projects based on their specialisations, or work in libraries and archives related to the arts.</p>", "keywords": ["disciplinary and interdisciplinary humanities", "creative arts", "arts", "art curation", "spectatorship", "theatre and performance studies", "creative writing", "theories of creativity", "artistic processes", "ethics in creative arts", "indigenous art", "auteur theory", "creative communities", "activism", "mediality"], "implementationYear": 2020, "urlMap": "/research/specialisations/2020/ARTSHR", "studyLevel": "Research", "curriculumStructure": [{"title": "Students must complete 72 UOC.", "description": "", "creditPoints": 72, "relationships": [], "children": [{"title": "Course B", "description": "<p>Students must take 6 UOC of the following courses.</p>", "creditPoints": 6, "relationships": [{"name": "Research and the Creative Arts", "description": "ARTS5204 - Research and the Creative Arts", "type": "", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ARTS5204", "url": "/research/courses/2020/ARTS5204", "order": 1}], "children": [], "order": 2}, {"title": "Research Thesis", "description": "<p>In addition to the core courses, students must also complete a 25,000 word research thesis (54 UOC).</p>", "creditPoints": 54, "relationships": [{"name": "Master of Philosophy Thesis A", "description": "ARTS8100 - Master of Philosophy Thesis A", "type": "", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ARTS8100", "url": "/research/courses/2020/ARTS8100", "order": 1}, {"name": "Master of Philosophy Thesis B", "description": "ARTS8101 - Master of Philosophy Thesis B", "type": "", "creditPoints": 12, "itemCode": "ARTS8101", "url": "/research/courses/2020/ARTS8101", "order": 2}], "children": [], "order": 4}, {"title": "Course C", "description": "<p>Students must take 6 UOC of the following courses.</p>", "creditPoints": 6, "relationships": [{"name": "Research Specialisation", "description": "ARTS5206 - Research Specialisation", "type": "", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ARTS5206", "url": "/research/courses/2020/ARTS5206", "order": 1}], "children": [], "order": 3}, {"title": "Course A", "description": "<p>Students must take 6 UOC of the following courses.</p>", "creditPoints": 6, "relationships": [{"name": "Intellectual Foundations and Methods of Research", "description": "ARTS5200 - Intellectual Foundations and Methods of Research", "type": "", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ARTS5200", "url": "/research/courses/2020/ARTS5200", "order": 1}], "children": [], "order": 1}], "order": 1}], "structureSummary": "", "schoolName": "N/A", "facultyName": "Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences", "creditPoints": 72, "academicItemType": "Specialisation"}, {"code": "CRTVAR", "title": "Creative Practice", "description": "<p>This specialisation covers study towards the PhD undertaken in the School of the Arts and Media in the areas of creative writing, practice-based research, and music composition.
