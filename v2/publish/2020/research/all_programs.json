During this program you will have access to regular workshops, during which you will learn how to plan and undertake research and evaluation projects, skills which you will immediately put into use in your organisation. Research shows that staff members who feel engaged and supported are more likely to remain with their employers. So the benefits for you and your organisation are that you will develop your skills to a higher level and be able to directly contribute your growing expertise and experience to your organisation while you learn.
