It supports creative practices such as video, animation, sculpture, installation, performance, audio and experimental approaches to image capture.</li><li><strong>Future Making Studio</strong> - which focuses on the making of objects, whether with new materials and digital technologies or traditional craftsmanship. It addresses the integration of technical knowledge and skills with material and contextual understanding. Future Making works with ceramics, jewellery, metal, textiles, furniture and lighting.</li></ul>\n\n<p>As well, students may take studio courses from areas of practice offered in Program 9313 Master of Design.</p>\n\n<p>The Master of Art provides for pathways for both those with backgrounds in art and those who wish to enter art from other professional backgrounds.

The GCCM structure is designed to be flexible, with courses being available in 3 terms each year. Typically, in each term\u00a0students take 1 or 2 courses, but if other commitments make it difficult to take a course in a particular term, students may take a break and apply for Program Leave. To graduate with the GCCM students need to successfully complete 4 courses which can be completed within 1-2 years part-time.</p>\n\n<p>The objective of the GCCM is to develop effective agents of change. You and your course colleagues will learn how to influence organisational change, both through your own actions and those of others. The program provides the theoretical foundation for understanding organisational change and the practical skills to facilitate the development and implementation of change strategies\u00a0successfully.</p>\n\n<p>Benefits to match your interests:</p>\n\n<ul><li>to learn the practical skills, techniques and knowledge to achieve successful change in your organisation</li><li>to develop personal capabilities as a leader and change agent</li><li>to build re-shaping capabilities in your organisation to enable sustainable change</li><li>to avoid the common disruptors\u00a0of change</li><li>to use new organisational change strategies to ensure sound theory underpins your practice</li><li>to develop a critical understanding of group and team dynamics</li><li>to apply the learning immediately with job-specific solutions to current business problems in your own workplace</li><li>to gain a future perspective on change that will prepare your organisation for tomorrow&#39;s challenges</li></ul>\n\n<p>The GCCM is centred around action learning (also called &#39;experiential learning&#39;) which involves drawing on your personal experiences to formulate new concepts. The focus is on students as opposed to facilitators. Course exercises and issues relevant to your organisation form the content of the GCCM program. Readings from the course materials and online discussions with study colleagues encourage you to analyse your job experiences in a structured way. The aim is to develop your capacity to formulate new concepts and apply them to course projects and your workplace. Study and research time is optimised through flexible online learning in a collaborative learning environment.</p>\n\n<p>The program is delivered completely online. There are some opportunities for face-to-face offerings.\u00a0</p>\n", "implementationYear": 2019, "urlMap": "/postgraduate/programs/2019/7315", "studyLevel": "Postgraduate", "curriculumStructure": [{"title": "Students must complete 24 UOC as a standalone program.", "description": "", "creditPoints": 24, "relationships": [], "children": [{"title": "Core Courses", "description": "<p>Students must take 24 UOC of the following courses.</p>", "creditPoints": 24, "relationships": [{"name": "Redesigning the Organisation", "description": "MBAX6273 - Redesigning the Organisation", "type": "", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "MBAX6273", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2019/MBAX6273", "order": 3}, {"name": "Systems for Change", "description": "MBAX6274 - Systems for Change", "type": "", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "MBAX6274", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2019/MBAX6274", "order": 4}, {"name": "Approaches to Change", "description": "MBAX6271 - Approaches to Change", "type": "", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "MBAX6271", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2019/MBAX6271", "order": 1}, {"name": "Change Skills", "description": "MBAX6272 - Change Skills", "type": "", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "MBAX6272", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2019/MBAX6272", "order": 2}], "children": [], "order": 1}], "order": 1}], "structureSummary": "", "schoolName": "", "facultyName": "UNSW Business School", "creditPoints": 24, "academicItemType": "Program", "intakePeriod": ["Term 2", "Term 3", "Term 1"], "additionalInformation": "", "programConstraints": []}, {"code": "5151", "title": "City Analytics", "description": "<p>With an increasing urbanised world there is a critical need to do more with less.

The Master of Special Operations and Irregular Warfare uniquely addresses this gap by offering students a combination of special operations focused core courses, irregular warfare focused core courses and a selection of electives addressing broader issues in strategy and security. This combination provides the student both a focused view of the phenomenon of special operations and irregular warfare and a broad understanding of their context. The Master of Special Operations and Irregular Warfare is ideal for military personnel seeking to broaden their understanding of\u00a0those forms of warfare that exist to challenge conventionally-orientated militaries. The program also provides an excellent framework of reference for other government employees and contractors who require a good understanding of Special Operations and Irregular threats.

Taught by leading tax academics, the program provides exposure to complex aspects of the discipline and a critical understanding of the Australian taxation system. The program also emphasises developing skills in research, analysis and sustained self-directed writing, including relevant skills in collecting and organising material.</p>\n\n<p>The program offers five specialisations:<br />\nTaxation; International Taxation; Revenue Administration; Applied Taxation; and Taxation and Financial Planning.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n\n<p>Develops an advanced taxation knowledge base and advanced professional skills in taxation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>International Taxation</strong></p>\n\n<p>Develops a basic and advanced international taxation knowledge base and advanced professional skills in the practical application of international tax knowledge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Revenue Administration</strong></p>\n\n<p>Suitable if you are currently working in revenue authorities or related agencies, particularly in developing and transitional economies (including those located in the Pacific, Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe). This specialisation will equip you for work in the revenue administration and treasury areas of the public service, or for work in consultancies, and agencies related to these areas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Applied Tax</strong></p>\n\n<p>Provides the essentials needed to understand what tax advice is needed as part of accounting, business management and advising work. The curriculum is restricted so as to meet professional expectations relevant to Australian tax practitioners.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Taxation and Financial Planning</strong></p>\n\n<p>Provides multi-disciplinary (Taxation, Law and Business) specialised education in financial planning and personal wealth accumulation. Suitable if you are seeking a career in this area or if you are looking to transit into this sector, whether in private professional practice, in commerce, or in government service.</p>\n\n<p>Assessment for the Master of Taxation courses emphasises analysis and sustained writing in current problem areas and constructive contributions to the professional debate on key problems. This requires you to engage in sustained application of analytical skills and writing in your primary areas of advanced work and encourages you to add to the body of knowledge and critical understanding in such areas.</p>\n\n<p>The Master of Taxation can be studied on a full-time basis (four courses in one semester) or part-time basis (one or two courses per semester).

The program covers the drivers of change and theories of cities; the key urban strategy challenges; decision making and policy administration; public and private development finance; policy instruments and their assessment; advanced research methods; and urban leadership, politics and ethics. The program includes three BE select electives which will facilitate a focus on specific urban policy issues.</p>\n\n<p>The program is run over three semesters (Semester 1, Semester 2 and Summer Term). The program can be taken full-time or part-time. Courses in the program will be delivered in intensive teaching blocks in order to enable those working full-time and interstate to participate. Students can undertake a Graduate Certificate, Graduate Diploma or a full Masters degree.</p>\n\n<p>The program will utilise a number of different teaching strategies including: studios, master classes, problem-based learning, case studies and field trips, consulting projects with clients, and evidence-based research.
