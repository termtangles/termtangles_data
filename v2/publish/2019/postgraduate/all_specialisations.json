Sustainable forms of energy are of priority in the modern world. Geothermal energy is one of the sustainable forms energy where the heat energy generated and stored in Earth are applied. More than 90 countries in the world have proven Geothermal energy resources. Recently, there has been significant investment in this resource globally. Australia and New Zealand also have enormous Geothermal resources. The exploitation of these resources has a large overlap with Petroleum Engineering methods including reservoir characterization and drilling methods. However, there is a need for extra research for the familiarity of students with these resources at an advanced level.<br />\n<br />\nFurther, today&#39;s leaders in energy disciplines need to be able to move from the existing body of knowledge in the profession to develop new and innovative solutions to problems covering the technical aspects of earth exploration and development, to project economics, and to the environmental and social context of the industry. Therefore, the stream includes a range of courses with a research or enquiry-based learning component. These enquiry-based components involve students solving an open-ended problem through the integration of taught material with their own investigation into the problem and developing their own solutions.", "keywords": ["petroleum engineering", "masters", "geothermics", "geothermal engineering", "heat mining", "renewable energy", "geoscience", "reservoir", "geothermal power", "egs", "engineered geothermal systems", "geo", "thermal resources", "hot dry rock", "drilling", "australia", "energy", "geomechanics", "geochemistry"], "implementationYear": 2019, "urlMap": "/postgraduate/specialisations/2019/PTRLIS", "studyLevel": "Postgraduate", "curriculumStructure": [{"title": "Students must complete 96 UOC.", "description": "", "creditPoints": 96, "relationships": [], "children": [{"title": "Advanced Disciplinary Knowledge Core Courses", "description": "<p><p>Students must take 18 UOC of the following courses.</p></p>", "creditPoints": 18, "relationships": [{"name": "Natural Gas Engineering", "description": "PTRL5010 -

Irrespective of the outcome of &#39;new build&#39; proposals in the Western world, there is an existing portfolio of reactors that require maintenance, servicing, operation and eventually decommissioning. There is waste to be managed and there is a fuel cycle that requires servicing and handling. They all necessitate engineers with an understanding of the unique environment experienced at nuclear sites.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, many countries are assessing nuclear energy programmes as one of a number of mechanisms to provide secure, low-carbon energy, and some have embarked on national nuclear build programmes. Such programmes are raising many global challenges, not least due to proliferation concerns and environmental security.</p>\n\n<p>The long-term needs of the nuclear engineering field are clear and many nations have long-term commitments to nuclear engineering including conventional power generation, radiological applications in medicine and healthcare, and proliferation monitoring and control. There is an ageing workforce in the sector and ample opportunities for nuclear engineering graduates.</p>\n\n<p>Hence there is a strong need for a new generation of nuclear-conversant engineers. The development of nuclear engineering skills is a timely opportunity for engineering graduates. The aim of the Nuclear Engineering stream is to educate and inform engineering graduates in the underpinning theory behind nuclear engineering techniques, technologies and processes, and provides a stream that allows engineering graduates, from traditional engineering disciplines, to prepare themselves for a career in nuclear engineering.

Therefore, the petroleum specialisation requires the study of a range of courses that would allow a student from a non-Petroleum Engineering background to become competent working in a role that requires the direct application of Petroleum Engineering knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Another characteristic of the oil &amp; gas industry is that the development and integration of new technology, as well as changes to the socio-political context of the industry, mean that Petroleum Engineers require deeper knowledge of the discipline combined with an understanding of how these innovations change the way Petroleum Engineering is practised. Therefore, the specialisation enables students from a Petroleum Engineering background to extend and broaden their knowledge of the discipline&#39;s context.</p>\n\n<p>Further, today&#39;s leaders in Petroleum Engineering need to be able to move from the existing body of knowledge in the profession to develop new and innovative solutions to problems covering the technical aspects of petroleum exploration and development, to project economics, and to the environmental and social context of the industry. Therefore, the stream includes a range of courses with a research or enquiry-based learning component.

Policy is part of every field of practice, which has led to a rapid growth in the need for policy professionals in government, business, and social and political organisations.</p>\n\n<p>The Master of Public Policy and Governance (MPPG) applies a social science perspective to questions of policy and management in modern organisations. You will acquire a solid grounding in policy analysis, policy evaluation and social research, the necessary skills and knowledge domains required for effective engagement within the policy process. You will be able to specialise in an area of direct relevance to your own interests, which may include Social Policy, International Development Policy or Policy Management.</p>\n\n<p>The program will prepare you for professional practice, by fostering analytical skills and a practical appreciation of the processes of policymaking, the significance of research and evidence in driving policy change and the role of stakeholders in effective policy implementation. The Master of Public Policy and Governance places emphasis on developing the skills and perspectives needed for proficient assessment, evaluation and sensitivity to the effectiveness of policy programs in terms of the impact they have on clients, customers and the public.</p>\n\n<p>Unique to the UNSW Master of Public Policy and Governance is the significant policy and research experience of the program&#39;s teaching staff. At UNSW, the staff involved in the MPPG have had direct experience either as policy makers or policy researchers in government, non-government organisations and, the business sectors. Combined, they have over 20 years direct experience working at high levels inside government, from providing policy support to the Council of Australian Governments through to conceptualising, designing and implementing large scale policy across the states. Staff are also actively involved with non-government organisations in providing effectively policy research and evidence to support their advocacy and lobbying activities. These teaching staff bring their real life experience to the classroom, revealing the relationship between theory, research and everyday practice.</p>\n\n<p>The Master of Public Policy and Governance aims to prepare you for work which requires analytical skills and a practical appreciation of the processes of policy-making and implementation. The program is oriented to the practice of policy, and prospective students are required to have relevant work experience. This may be in the public sector, unions, business or community organisations.</p>\n", "keywords": ["social research & policy program", "public policy and governance", "governance", "government", "policy", "public policy", "social policy"], "implementationYear": 2019, "urlMap": "/postgraduate/specialisations/2019/SRAPES", "studyLevel": "Postgraduate", "curriculumStructure": [{"title": "Students must complete 48 UOC.", "description": "", "creditPoints": 48, "relationships": [], "children": [{"title": "Admission Block Credit", "description": "<p>If you are in program 8259 Public Policy & Governance you will have been issued 48 UOC Admission Block Credit.

Thus solutions to health problems often lie outside the health system - in social policy, urban design, community cohesion, personal relationships, and the penal system, to name but a few. The Master of Public Health stream in Social Research provides students with training in sociological conceptualisations of health and in approaches to health issues using both quantitative/epidemiological and qualitative/interpretive methods. It consists of core MPH courses, with a stream-defining course on sociological approaches to public health, two research methodology courses, and a selection of recommended MPH electives with social emphasis. The stream is taught by staff with a broad range of disciplinary backgrounds including sociology, psychology, political science, anthropology, ethnography, epidemiology, statistics, education, linguistics and philosophy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who should do this stream?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This MPH degree focuses on the social aspects of health and social approaches to addressing public health problems. You may be a social science graduate seeking training in public health research skills, or a public health or healthcare practitioner wanting to develop your understanding of social influences on health and illness.</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in carrying out research, the degree provides a clear pathway towards further academic research training (e.g. a PhD) or research in the workplace (government policy, program evaluation etc.). Graduates from this stream develop the knowledge and skills to enter postgraduate research degrees that require expertise in either social epidemiology or qualitative research, or both.</p>\n\n<p>This stream is for anyone who wants to change public health and health policy for the better - even when change means political action or social change outside the healthcare system. Much medical and health research does not make a difference, because it stays in the medical journals. This degree will equip you to see the social and structural problems that prevent useful policy change, and find ways to address them.</p>\n", "keywords": ["public health and community medicine", "social research", "public health", "social policy", "health policy", "qualitative research", "social studies of public health", "health sociology", "social science"], "implementationYear": 2019, "urlMap": "/postgraduate/specialisations/2019/PHCMVS", "studyLevel": "Postgraduate", "curriculumStructure": [{"title": "Students must complete 30 UOC.", "description": "", "creditPoints": 30, "relationships": [], "children": [{"title": "Social Research Methodology Courses", "description": "<p><p>Students must take 12 UOC of the following courses.</p><p>Note: *Students with appropriate background qualifications may choose only one of the methodology courses, with permission of the stream convenor, and elect to conduct a supervised research project on a social research-related topic or Internship by enrolling in either PHCM9143 Internship (6 UOC) or PHCM9148 Project 6 Units of Credit (6 UOC).</p></p>", "creditPoints": 6, "relationships": [{"name": "Applied Research Methods for Public Health", "description": "PHCM9132 -
