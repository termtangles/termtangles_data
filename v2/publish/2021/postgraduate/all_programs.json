The GCCM structure is designed to be flexible, with courses being available in 3 terms each year. Typically, in each term\u00a0students take 1 or 2 courses, but if other commitments make it difficult to take a course in a particular term, students may take a break and apply for Program Leave. To graduate with the GCCM students need to successfully complete 4 courses which can be completed within 1-2 years part-time.</p>\n\n<p>The objective of the GCCM is to develop effective agents of change. You and your course colleagues will learn how to influence organisational change, both through your own actions and those of others. The program provides the theoretical foundation for understanding organisational change and the practical skills to facilitate the development and implementation of change strategies\u00a0successfully.</p>\n\n<p>Benefits to match your interests:</p>\n\n<ul><li>to learn the practical skills, techniques and knowledge to achieve successful change in your organisation</li><li>to develop personal capabilities as a leader and change agent</li><li>to build re-shaping capabilities in your organisation to enable sustainable change</li><li>to avoid the common disruptors\u00a0of change</li><li>to use new organisational change strategies to ensure sound theory underpins your practice</li><li>to develop a critical understanding of group and team dynamics</li><li>to apply the learning immediately with job-specific solutions to current business problems in your own workplace</li><li>to gain a future perspective on change that will prepare your organisation for tomorrow&#39;s challenges</li></ul>\n\n<p>The GCCM is centred around action learning (also called &#39;experiential learning&#39;) which involves drawing on your personal experiences to formulate new concepts. The focus is on students as opposed to facilitators. Course exercises and issues relevant to your organisation form the content of the GCCM program. Readings from the course materials and online discussions with study colleagues encourage you to analyse your job experiences in a structured way. The aim is to develop your capacity to formulate new concepts and apply them to course projects and your workplace. Study and research time is optimised through flexible online learning in a collaborative learning environment.</p>\n\n<p>The program is delivered completely online.

In addition, the program examines power and politics in global health, key global health debates and philosophy. It addresses issues around globalisation and health, decolonisation, health and human rights, the environment, urban expansion and population growth.</p>\n\n<p>The MGHext program trains global health leaders of tomorrow, who are work-ready, robust and flexible to work across many settings and jurisdictions. You will graduate with a firm understanding of global health issues, advanced disciplinary knowledge and technical capacities, as well as the passion to drive solutions in global health. The MGHext provides graduates with additional specialised research skills required not only for the execution of research, but for its commissioning, funding, assessment and evaluation. These skills are highly valued in research and population health-based roles, which help to shape global health priorities. You will be taught by our experienced multidisciplinary team of research-active academics who work across the Asia-Pacific and sub-Saharan African regions and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>Our MGHext graduates

You will acquire a solid grounding in policy analysis, policy evaluation and social research, the necessary skills and knowledge domains required for effective engagement within the policy process. You will be able to specialise in an area of direct relevance to your own interests, which may include Social Policy, International Development Policy or Policy Management.</p>\n\n<p>The program will prepare you for professional practice, by fostering analytical skills and a practical appreciation of the processes of policymaking, the significance of research and evidence in driving policy change and the role of stakeholders in effective policy implementation.

At UNSW, the staff involved in the MPPG have had direct experience either as policy makers or policy researchers in government, non-government organisations and, the business sectors. Combined, they have over 20 years direct experience working at high levels inside government, from providing policy support to the Council of Australian Governments through to conceptualising, designing and implementing large scale policy across the states. Staff are also actively involved with non-government organisations in providing effectively policy research and evidence to support their advocacy and lobbying activities. These teaching staff bring their real life experience to the classroom, revealing the relationship between theory, research and everyday practice.</p>\n\n<p>The Master of Public Policy and Governance aims to prepare you for work which requires analytical skills and a practical appreciation of the processes of policy-making and implementation.

Such conflict is the definition of irregular warfare, yet this type of warfare is not well addressed within academia.\u00a0Within these conflicts, the employment of special operations forces has been seen on an unprecedented scale, yet special operations also remains an understudied and often misunderstood instrument of military policy. The Master of Special Operations and Irregular Warfare uniquely addresses this gap by offering students a combination of special operations focused core courses, irregular warfare focused core courses and a selection of electives addressing broader issues in strategy and security. This combination provides the student both a focused view of the phenomenon of special operations and irregular warfare and a broad understanding of their context. The Master of Special Operations and Irregular Warfare is ideal for military personnel seeking to broaden their understanding of\u00a0those forms of warfare that exist to challenge conventionally-orientated militaries. The program also provides an excellent framework of reference for other government employees and contractors who require a good understanding of Special Operations and Irregular threats.

Translating strategy implementation and detailing how organisations can achieve sustained effectiveness, with both its current challenges and future possibilities, is critical for success.</p>\n\n<p>The Graduate Certificate in Strategic Management provides students with applied, critical thinking and application skills for effective strategy implementation. With a focus on a spectrum of principles and features that influence strategy execution, it helps develop practical insights into organisational transformation with themes on the strategic process of managing for change, redesigning structure, human capital and talent management, and smart responses to technology. The program examines the strategic role and organisational value of digital technologies, including digitally enabled innovation, digital ecosystems, and digital transformation and disruption, to realise business value potential.</p>\n\n<p>Graduates will be challenged to think critically and to develop useful insights about the concepts and principles on making better strategy. This includes how to develop and successfully implement strategy, aligning strategy to operating models, governance and culture, leading for high performance, the significance of power and influence, models for leading change and mastering the complexity and plurality of strategic management. Current and emerging approaches and frameworks for strategic decision-making are embedded throughout the program to help establish an alignment between leadership and organisation purpose.</p>\n\n<p>The program provides a flexible and collaborative learning environment with courses offered in face-to-face and online delivery modes.</p>\n", "implementationYear": 2021, "urlMap": "/postgraduate/programs/2021/7417", "studyLevel": "Postgraduate", "curriculumStructure": [{"title": "Prescribed Electives", "description": "Students must take at least 18 UOC of the following courses.", "creditPoints": 18, "relationships": [{"name": "Negotiations and Strategy", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "MNGT5388", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/MNGT5388", "order": 5}, {"name": "Strategies for Growth", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "MNGT5395", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/MNGT5395", "order": 6}, {"name": "Digital Strategy", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "MBAX9152", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/MBAX9152", "order": 2}, {"name": "Implementing Strategy", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "MBAX9153", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/MBAX9153", "order": 3}, {"name": "Leadership", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "MBAX9131", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/MBAX9131", "order": 1}, {"name": "Operationalising Strategy", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "MNGT5180", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/MNGT5180", "order": 4}], "children": [], "order": 2}, {"title": "Core Courses", "description": "Students must take 6 UOC of the following courses.", "creditPoints": 6, "relationships": [], "children": [{"title": "One of the following:", "description": "", "creditPoints": 0, "relationships": [{"name": "Strategic Management", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "MBAX9143", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/MBAX9143", "order": 1}, {"name": "Strategy", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "MNGT5282", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/MNGT5282", "order": 2}], "children": [], "order": 1}], "order": 1}], "structureSummary": "<p>Students must complete 24 UOC when taken as a standalone program.</p>", "schoolName": "AGSM MBA Programs", "facultyName": "UNSW Business School", "creditPoints": 24, "academicItemType": "Program", "intakePeriod": ["Term 2", "Term 3", "Term 1"], "additionalInformation": "", "programConstraints": []}, {"code": "8563", "title": "Strategic People Management", "description": "<p>The Master of Strategic People Management (MStratPMgt) is designed to develop middle managers, particularly in the area of people management.

The excellence of our school-university program stems from an emphasis on four pillars: school communities, feedback and dialogue, inspired learning through inspired teaching, and being digital.</p>\n<p>As a new program that began in 2018, there is an emphasis on applying the latest research into evidence-based practice and ensuring our staff model the use of the most up-to-date technologies and approaches to curriculum. The program takes into account contemporary and emerging developments in education, curriculum requirements, community expectations, and our local and national employer needs and workforce demands.</p>\n<p>The program is a two-year equivalent accelerated primary teacher degree that can be completed in four terms full-time (1.3 years). While the program is fixed (students will overload and complete 4 courses each term), part-time study is possible. The program is accredited by the NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA), enabling graduates to teach in both government and non-government primary schools in all states of Australia and overseas.</p>\n<p>Throughout the program you will develop the requisite knowledge and skills to enable you to meet the Australian graduate teacher standards. Academic lecturers and local teachers with experience in primary education work together to provide core education courses and discipline-specific curriculum and pedagogy studies within the six key learning areas of the primary curriculum:</p>\n<ul><li>English</li><li>Mathematics</li><li>Science and Technology</li><li>History and Geography</li><li>Creative Arts</li><li>Personal Development, Health and Physical Education</li></ul>\n<p>Your professional journey to becoming a graduate teacher is enriched through the dynamic interaction of practice and theory through site-based experiences during your degree program. The journey begins with your In-School Teacher Education Program (INSTEP) that commences in the first few weeks of term one. During the first year of your program, you will spend up to 60 days in primary schools for practical INSTEP experiences. Your first year also includes a four-week block of professional experience (practicum) in university term two where you teach your first whole-class lessons under the careful supervision and scaffolding provided by an expert supervising teacher. This solid block of professional experience is a great foundation to your coursework and continuing INSTEP in the second half of year one. Your professional learning journey as a teacher education student culminates in the second year with a nine-week block of professional experience (practicum) at a different school complemented by two courses to complete your program. Overall, you will gain practical site-based experience for up to 60 days (INSTEP) and enhance your practice while engaged in 65 days (minimum) of supervised professional experience that concludes with a moderated standardised graduate teacher performance assessment.</p>", "implementationYear": 2021, "urlMap": "/postgraduate/programs/2021/8925", "studyLevel": "Postgraduate", "curriculumStructure": [{"title": "Year 2 Core Courses", "description": "You must take 24 UOC of the following courses:<br /><br />Please note: Before enrolling in EDST6765 you must complete 72 UOC.", "creditPoints": 24, "relationships": [{"name": "Personal Development, Health and Physical Education (K-6)", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "EDST6785", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/EDST6785", "order": 3}, {"name": "Professional Experience 2/Internship", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 12, "itemCode": "EDST6765", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/EDST6765", "order": 2}, {"name": "Professional Inquiry", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "EDST5117", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/EDST5117", "order": 1}], "children": [], "order": 3}, {"title": "Year 1 Core Courses", "description": "You must complete 72 UOC of the following courses:", "creditPoints": 72, "relationships": [{"name": "Creating Engaging Learning Environments", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "EDST5133", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/EDST5133", "order": 2}, {"name": "Child Development: Psychological & Social Perspectives", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "EDST5151", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/EDST5151", "order": 4}, {"name": "Indigenous Contexts of Education", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "EDST5115", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/EDST5115", "order": 1}, {"name": "Creative Arts (K-6)", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "EDST6786", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/EDST6786", "order": 12}, {"name": "Science and Technology (K-6)", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "EDST6784", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/EDST6784", "order": 11}, {"name": "Addressing Special Needs", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "EDST5134", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/EDST5134", "order": 3}, {"name": "Mathematics 1 (Years K-2)", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "EDST6779", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/EDST6779", "order": 6}, {"name": "Professional Experience 1", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "EDST6760", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/EDST6760", "order": 5}, {"name": "Mathematics 2 (3-6)", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "EDST6780", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/EDST6780", "order": 7}, {"name": "English 1 (K-2)", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "EDST6781", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/EDST6781", "order": 8}, {"name": "English 2 (Years 3-6)", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "EDST6782", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/EDST6782", "order": 9}, {"name": "History and Geography (K-6)", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "EDST6783", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/EDST6783", "order": 10}], "children": [], "order": 2}, {"title": "Academic Writing Skills Courses", "description": "You can take an additional 6 UOC course to develop your academic writing skills.
