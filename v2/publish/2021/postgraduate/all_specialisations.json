The most well-known examples are payment systems (PayPal, WeChat, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency), portfolio management and Robo-advice (US, Europe, Australia), peer-to-peer lending (US, China, India and elsewhere), high-frequency trading (global), and decentralized finance (of which Bitcoin and cryptocurrency form the foundation). Established financial services firms (BigTech) and entrepreneurs (FinTech) both demand talent in this space as FinTech products are by nature scalable and have potential for huge impact in a financial services business.</p>\n<p>Co-developed with financial services industry experts, this specialisation introduces students to finance theory, financial products, markets, and institutions, then explores how big data and other technologies allow FinTech start-ups to cause consumers to shift away from traditional finance - fundamentally changing the way money is raised, transferred, stored, loaned, and invested around the world. In addition to a conceptual understanding of finance theory, financial markets, and financial services firms, students will experience FinTech courses via the Integrated Learning Laboratory (iLab). They will be able to gain personal access to financial market data platforms, handle financial market and unstructured data, learn how financial products work via the Python programming language, trade using the leading stock trading platform used by brokerage firms, and interact with practitioners.</p>\n<p>This specialisation in Financial Technology can be taken in the Master of Commerce or Master of Commerce (Extension). In the MCom (Ext.) students can combine FinTech with other complementary specialisations such as finance, business analytics, accounting, risk management, marketing, and more. </p>", "keywords": ["finance", "mcom extension", "mcom ext", "specialisation", "mcom specialisation", "mcom ext stream"], "implementationYear": 2021, "urlMap": "/postgraduate/specialisations/2021/FINSQS", "studyLevel": "Postgraduate", "curriculumStructure": [{"title": "GATEWAY CORE COURSE", "description": "Students must take 6 UOC of the following courses.", "creditPoints": 6, "relationships": [{"name": "Financial Markets and Institutions", "description": "FINS5512 - Financial Markets and Institutions", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "FINS5512", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/FINS5512", "order": 1}], "children": [], "order": 1}, {"title": "SPECIALISATION ELECTIVES", "description": "Students must take at least 30 UOC of the following courses.", "creditPoints": 30, "relationships": [], "children": [{"title": "One of the following:", "description": "", "creditPoints": 0, "relationships": [{"name": "Regulatory Technology and Compliance", "description": "FINS5549 - Regulatory Technology and Compliance", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "FINS5549", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/FINS5549", "order": 5}, {"name": "Investments and Portfolio Selection", "description": "FINS5513 - Investments and Portfolio Selection", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "FINS5513", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/FINS5513", "order": 3}, {"name": "Personal Financial Planning and Management", "description": "FINS5510 - Personal Financial Planning and Management", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "FINS5510", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/FINS5510", "order": 2}, {"name": "Entrepreneurial Ecosystems", "description": "COMM5040 - Entrepreneurial Ecosystems", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "COMM5040", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/COMM5040", "order": 1}, {"name": "Capital Budgeting and Financial Decisions", "description": "FINS5514 - Capital Budgeting and Financial Decisions", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "FINS5514", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/FINS5514", "order": 4}], "children": [], "order": 5}, {"title": "SPECIALISATION ELECTIVES", "description": "", "creditPoints": 0, "relationships": [{"name": "Financial Technology", "description": "FINS5548 - Financial Technology", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "FINS5548", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/FINS5548", "order": 4}, {"name": "Financial Market Data Literacy", "description": "FINS5545 - Financial Market Data Literacy", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "FINS5545", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/FINS5545", "order": 1}, {"name": "Cryptocurrency and Decentralised Finance", "description": "FINS5547 - Cryptocurrency and Decentralised Finance", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "FINS5547", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/FINS5547", "order": 3}, {"name": "Toolkit for Financial Market Decisions", "description": "FINS5546 - Toolkit for Financial Market Decisions", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "FINS5546", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/FINS5546", "order": 2}], "children": [], "order": 0}], "order": 2}], "structureSummary": "<p>Students must complete 36 UOC.</p>", "schoolName": "School of Banking and Finance", "facultyName": "UNSW Business School", "creditPoints": 36, "academicItemType": "Specialisation"}, {"code": "FOODOS", "title": "Food Process Engineering (5341)", "description": "<p>The specialisation in Food Process Engineering is defined by a core of disciplinary knowledge and advanced disciplinary knowledge.

"As the demand for energy increases globally, the need for new sources of energy becomes more important. Sustainable forms of energy are of priority in the modern world. Geothermal energy is one of the sustainable forms energy where the heat energy generated and stored in Earth are applied. More than 90 countries in the world have proven Geothermal energy resources. Recently, there has been significant investment in this resource globally. Australia and New Zealand also have enormous Geothermal resources. The exploitation of these resources has a large overlap with Petroleum Engineering methods including reservoir characterization and drilling methods. However, there is a need for extra research for the familiarity of students with these resources at an advanced level.<br />\n<br />\nFurther, today&#39;s leaders in energy disciplines need to be able to move from the existing body of knowledge in the profession to develop new and innovative solutions to problems covering the technical aspects of earth exploration and development, to project economics, and to the environmental and social context of the industry. Therefore, the stream includes a range of courses with a research or enquiry-based learning component. These enquiry-based components involve students solving an open-ended problem through the integration of taught material with their own investigation into the problem and developing their own

The program offers the opportunity to analyse issues such as the global economy and environment, international law and diplomacy, international and regional institutions, the conduct of war and the pursuit of international peace and security. In practical terms, you will study current issues of international concern, including economic uncertainty, environmental threats, humanitarian crises, human rights violations, global poverty and terrorism.</p>\n\n<p>The program emphasises the relationship between theory and practice in world politics; studying for the Master of International Relations will extend your existing knowledge and equip you with advanced skills to analyse world affairs.

Irrespective of the outcome of &#39;new build&#39; proposals in the Western world, there is an existing portfolio of reactors that require maintenance, servicing, operation and eventually decommissioning. There is waste to be managed and there is a fuel cycle that requires servicing and handling. They all necessitate engineers with an understanding of the unique environment experienced at nuclear sites.</p>\n<p>In addition, many countries are assessing nuclear energy programmes as one of a number of mechanisms to provide secure, low-carbon energy, and some have embarked on national nuclear build programmes. Such programmes are raising many global challenges, not least due to proliferation concerns and environmental security.</p>\n<p>The long-term needs of the nuclear engineering field are clear and many nations have long-term commitments to nuclear engineering including conventional power generation, radiological applications in medicine and healthcare, and proliferation monitoring and control. There is an ageing workforce in the sector and ample opportunities for nuclear engineering graduates.</p>\n<p>Hence there is a strong need for a new generation of nuclear-conversant engineers. The development of nuclear engineering skills is a timely opportunity for engineering graduates. The aim of the Nuclear Engineering stream is to educate and inform engineering graduates in the underpinning theory behind nuclear engineering techniques, technologies and processes, and provides a stream that allows engineering graduates, from traditional engineering disciplines, to prepare themselves for a career in nuclear engineering. The stream aims to produce graduates capable of embarking on a nuclear engineering career and contributing to the nuclear debate from a knowledgeable standpoint.</p>\n<p>The stream will have

Thus solutions to health problems often lie outside the health system - in social policy, urban design, community cohesion, personal relationships, and the penal system, to name but a few. The Master of Public Health stream in Social Research provides students with training in sociological conceptualisations of health and in approaches to health issues using both quantitative/epidemiological and qualitative/interpretive methods. It consists of core MPH courses, with a stream-defining course on sociological approaches to public health, two research methodology courses, and a selection of either an SPHCM elective, project, internship or independent studies. The stream is taught by staff with a broad range of disciplinary backgrounds including sociology, psychology, political science, anthropology, ethnography and epidemiology.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who should do this stream?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This MPH degree focuses on the social aspects of health and social approaches to addressing public health problems. You may be a social science graduate seeking training in public health research skills, or a public health or healthcare practitioner wanting to develop your understanding of social influences on health and illness.</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in carrying out research, the degree provides a clear pathway towards further academic research training (e.g. a PhD) or research in the workplace (government policy, program evaluation etc.). Graduates from this stream develop the knowledge and skills to enter postgraduate research degrees that require expertise in either social epidemiology or qualitative research, or both.</p>\n\n<p>This stream is for anyone who wants to change public health and health policy for the better - even when change means political action or social change outside the healthcare system. Much medical and health research does not make a difference, because it stays in the medical journals. This degree will equip you to see the social and structural problems that prevent useful policy change, and find ways to address them.</p>\n", "keywords": ["public health and community medicine", "social research", "public health", "social policy", "health policy", "qualitative research", "social studies of public health", "health sociology", "social science"], "implementationYear": 2021, "urlMap": "/postgraduate/specialisations/2021/PHCMVS", "studyLevel": "Postgraduate", "curriculumStructure": [{"title": "Specialisation Defining Courses", "description": "Students must take 6 UOC of the following courses.", "creditPoints": 6, "relationships": [{"name": "Politics, Surveillance and Public Health", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "PHCM9522", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/PHCM9522", "order": 0}], "children": [], "order": 0}, {"title": "Social Research Methodology Courses", "description": "Students must take 12 UOC of the following courses.<br />Note: *Students with appropriate background qualifications may choose only one of the methodology courses, with permission of the stream convenor, and elect to conduct a supervised research project on a social research-related topic or Internship by enrolling in either PHCM9143 Internship (6 UOC) or PHCM9148 Project 6 Units of Credit (6 UOC).", "creditPoints": 0, "relationships": [{"name": "Qualitative Research Methods", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "PHCM9120", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/PHCM9120", "order": 0}, {"name": "Applied Research Methods for Public Health", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "PHCM9132", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/PHCM9132", "order": 100}], "children": [], "order": 100}, {"title": "Project, Internship or Elective", "description": "Students must take one of the following: a 6 UOC postgraduate elective course offered by SPHCM, an internship, independent studies or a 6 UOC project in a topic related to social research. <br />any course matching the pattern: PHCM9### <br />PHCM9103 Independent Studies 6 OC<br />PHCM9143 Internship 6 UOC <br />PHCM9148 Minor Project 6 UOC", "creditPoints": 0, "relationships": [{"name": "Internship", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "PHCM9143", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/PHCM9143", "order": 100}, {"name": "Minor Project", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "PHCM9148", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/PHCM9148", "order": 200}, {"name": "Independent Study 6 Units of Credit", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "PHCM9103", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/PHCM9103", "order": 0}], "children": [], "order": 200}], "structureSummary": "<p>Students must complete 24 UOC.</p>", "schoolName": "School of Population Health", "facultyName": "Faculty of Medicine and Health", "creditPoints": 24, "academicItemType": "Specialisation"}, {"code": "SLSPAS", "title": "Social Science and Policy", "description": "The Graduate Diploma in Arts by Research (program 5275) is offered by Schools and approved disciplinary programs in UNSW Arts and Social Sciences.
