Courses are offered from the introductory level to the advanced and professional levels. Students not only develop their knowledge of the French language, but also gain intercultural awareness and understanding of the French-speaking world. They study cultures, communities, societies and literature in France and the Francophone world. The French language plays a key role in expressing the cultures and identities of the places in which it is spoken. Learning French will provide students with a privileged form of access to the cultural resources and complex patterns of life in other countries. Developing competence in French will have an important place in promoting relationships and mutual understanding between countries and peoples.</p>\n\n<p>There are two main components of language study. The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the target language. Acquiring target language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending other people&#39;s expression, both oral and written. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the French language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform understanding of French and Francophone cultures. These disciplines include linguistic, literary, cultural, historical and social productions. Via the study of the French language and associated disciplines, we aim:</p>\n\n<ol><li>to foster understanding of the experiences and world-views of French and Francophone cultures;</li><li>to develop informed understanding of human experiences, cultures, and societies where French is spoken;</li><li>to enable students to place contemporary Australian society and culture in an historical and comparative context vis-a-vis French and Francophone societies and cultures;</li><li>to develop the skills of critical, creative, and imaginative thinking about French and Francophone societies, cultures, and the arts;</li><li>to promote the techniques and value of reasoned and open-minded discussion and debate.</li></ol>\n\n<p>This plan is available to students commencing at Advanced and Professional entry levels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Placement Information</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students who wish to enrol in a language course without completing the necessary prerequisites are required to complete an online placement application form before the commencement of the term.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, please see the\u00a0<a href=\"http://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">School Website</a>.</p>\n", "keywords": ["french"], "implementationYear": 2021, "urlMap": "/undergraduate/specialisations/2021/FRENE1", "studyLevel": "Undergraduate", "curriculumStructure": [{"title": "Professional Language Courses", "description": "You must take 12 UOC of the following courses.<br /><br />If you commence Professional Level with Professional French B, you must complete a Professional Studies course in place of Professional French A to meet the requirements of 24 UOC at the Professional Level.", "creditPoints": 12, "relationships": [{"name": "Professional French A", "description": "ARTS3482 -

The study of anatomy now embraces separate but strongly related disciplines: gross anatomy deals with the description of form, arrangement and function of the bones, joints, muscles and internal organs, together with their blood and nerve supply; histology deals with the microscopic structure of tissues and cells; embryology is concerned with the normal development of the embryo and fetus from conception to birth and with the mechanisms of development and malformations; neuroanatomy deals with the internal organisation and functions of the brain and spinal cord; biological anthropology involves applying biological principles and approaches to the study of humans &amp; non-human primates. <br />\n<br />\nIn all anatomy courses strong emphasis is given to the functional significance of the structures in health and in disease.", "keywords": ["anatomy"], "implementationYear": 2021, "urlMap": "/undergraduate/specialisations/2021/ANATB2", "studyLevel": "Undergraduate", "curriculumStructure": [{"title": "Level 2 Prescribed Electives", "description": "Students must take at least 6 UOC of the following courses.", "creditPoints": 6, "relationships": [{"name": "Histology: Basic and Systematic", "description": "ANAT2241 - Histology: Basic and Systematic", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ANAT2241", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ANAT2241", "order": 1}, {"name": "Biological Anthropology: Principles and Practices", "description": "ANAT2521 - Biological Anthropology: Principles and Practices", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ANAT2521", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ANAT2521", "order": 3}, {"name": "Embryology", "description": "ANAT2341 - Embryology", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ANAT2341", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ANAT2341", "order": 2}], "children": [], "order": 2}, {"title": "Level 3 Prescribed Electives", "description": "Students must take at least 6 UOC of the following courses.", "creditPoints": 6, "relationships": [{"name": "Functional Anatomy of the Limbs", "description": "ANAT3141 - Functional Anatomy of the Limbs", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ANAT3141", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ANAT3141", "order": 3}, {"name": "Neuroanatomy", "description": "ANAT3411 - Neuroanatomy", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ANAT3411", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ANAT3411", "order": 4}, {"name": "Visceral Anatomy", "description": "ANAT3121 - Visceral Anatomy", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ANAT3121", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ANAT3121", "order": 1}, {"name": "Cellular Mechanisms of Health and Disease", "description": "SOMS3232 - Cellular Mechanisms of Health and Disease", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "SOMS3232", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/SOMS3232", "order": 5}, {"name": "Functional Anatomy of the Head, Neck and Back", "description": "ANAT3131 - Functional Anatomy of the Head, Neck and Back", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ANAT3131", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ANAT3131", "order": 2}], "children": [], "order": 4}, {"title": "Core Courses", "description": "Students must take 18 UOC of the following courses.", "creditPoints": 18, "relationships": [{"name": "Molecules, Cells and Genes", "description": "BABS1201 - Molecules, Cells and Genes", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "BABS1201", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/BABS1201", "order": 2}, {"name": "Introductory Anatomy", "description": "ANAT2111 - Introductory Anatomy", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ANAT2111", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ANAT2111", "order": 1}, {"name": "Evolutionary and Functional Biology", "description": "BIOS1101 - Evolutionary and Functional Biology", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "BIOS1101", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/BIOS1101", "order": 3}], "children": [], "order": 1}, {"title": "Level 2/3 Prescribed Electives", "description": "Students must take at least 6 UOC of the following courses.", "creditPoints": 6, "relationships": [], "children": [], "order": 3}], "structureSummary": "<p>Students must complete 36 UOC.</p>", "schoolName": "School of Medical Sciences", "facultyName": "Faculty of Medicine and Health", "creditPoints": 36, "academicItemType": "Specialisation"}, {"code": "SOMSEH", "title": "Anatomy", "description": "<p>The Anatomy\u00a0Honours stream introduces undergraduate students to medical research.

understanding of a specific aspects of biotechnology while developing their critical thinking, writing and presentation skills.</p>\n\n<p>Students undertake a supervised research project in an area of research significance as approved by the Head of School. The BABS BSc (Hons) Degree provides an opportunity for students to experience hands-on scientific research. Honours students become part of a research team within one of the research labs in the School, and complete a supervised research project and thesis during the year-long program.</p>\n\n<p>A key benefit of the Honours year is that it provides for a different type of learning experience. It proceeds at the pace of the individual student, with suitable supervisory oversight providing relevant training in an informal, relaxed atmosphere. Honours is also an opportunity for the student to undertake measured and reflective decision making about their future scientific career. Examples of recent projects and further information regarding Honours in Biotechnology can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students/honours-mphil-projects\" rel=\"nofollow\">Honours and MPhil Projects</a> page on the BABS website.</p>\n\n<p>Honours in Biotechnology is to be completed full-time.\u00a0Students commence their enrolment in Term 1 (T1) or Term 2 (T2) or Term 3 (T3). Students should check with the undergraduate school administrator and honours coordinator for current enrolment deadlines and completion dates.</p>\n\n<p>Students must enrol in BABS4516 BABS Honours\u00a0 (16 UOC) for three terms.</p>\n\n<p>The program involves a research project that forms the majority of the assessment. The project, although supervised, is to be completed with substantial independence and self-direction. In addition, the program involves a series of student consultations, tutorials and seminars. Students should seek to meet with other School researchers and academics to stimulate research ideas and aid the research process. Honours Students must attend a series of compulsory workshops on ethics, research design, data analysis, thesis writing, presentation skills and publishing (see Assessment below).</p>\n", "keywords": ["biotechnology"], "implementationYear": 2021, "urlMap": "/undergraduate/specialisations/2021/BIOTBH", "studyLevel": "Undergraduate", "curriculumStructure": [{"title": "Core Course", "description": "Students must enrol in the following course three times for a total of 48 UOC.", "creditPoints": 48, "relationships": [{"name": "Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences Honours", "description": "BABS4516 - Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences Honours", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 16, "itemCode": "BABS4516", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/BABS4516", "order": 1}], "children": [], "order": 1}], "structureSummary": "<p>Students must complete 48 UOC.</p>", "schoolName": "School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences", "facultyName": "Faculty of Science", "creditPoints": 48, "academicItemType": "Specialisation"}, {"code": "BIOTA1", "title": "Biotechnology", "description": "Biotechnology can be defined as the use of various biological processes to make products and perform services.

Product engineers work on the fluids that you use in your everyday life, including chemicals (cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, shampoos, paints, glues), foods, and drinks. As a product engineer, you will learn to take consumer needs and turn them into technical requirements, finding the right combinations of chemicals to deliver those properties and then developing the product and strategies for commercialisation and manufacture. You will learn how to apply your knowledge of engineering and chemistry to design complex chemical products for the pharmaceutical, consumer products and food industries. You&#39;ll master the entire development process, testing out ideas for products and extrapolating small scale, laboratory chemistry into large, industrial scale production. In the final year Product Design Project, you will work with industry partners to develop a new consumer product up to the point where it could be patented and commercialised. To get work ready, you&#39;ll apply these skills through 60 days of approved industry training.<br /><br />The courses listed below have to be completed to finish the degree, but the order in which they are taken is important and you need to follow advice on this. Many courses are offered only once per year and others have pre-requisites or exclusions which govern the order in which they can be taken. Both of these things can have a big impact on enrolment planning if poor choices of course combinations are made. You are strongly encouraged to consult the School website and follow the recommended course sequence linked <a href=\"https://www.engineering.unsw.edu.au/study-with-us/undergraduate-degrees/chemical-product-engineering\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.<br /><br />The timing of the general education courses and elective courses may be modified to optimise your choice of courses. It is your responsibility to plan your enrolment appropriately. Assistance is available from Engineering Student Support Services, should you require it.</p>", "keywords": ["chemical engineering and industrial chemistry", "chemistry", "engineering", "honours",

Students should check the Chemistry Honours webpages for current enrolment deadlines, and assessment and completion dates.<br />\n<br />\nThe Chemistry Honours stream involves undertaking a research project that, although conducted under supervision, contains substantial independent research and self-direction. The research project is described in a submitted Project Thesis that forms the largest component of the assessment. The Project Thesis is complemented by introductory written and oral background presentations, oral presentation of the research project, and an oral examination (viva voce). Students are also required to attend compulsory Workplace Health and Safety training, relevant inductions, as well as School seminars.<br />\n<br />\nThe Chemistry Honours stream also contains an advanced coursework component.

A large corporation, for example, may borrow funds to purchase new plant and equipment by issuing further stock while an individual may save by purchasing stocks or government bonds. Markets for financial instruments also arise because firms and individuals want to manage financial risk. For example, a large corporation may bet against the risk of large fluctuations in the Australian - U.S. dollar exchange rate by selling its goods by way of futures contracts. Understanding how the prices of financial instruments are determined in the market place is a central concern of financial economics, along with the design of new financial derivatives.<br />\n<br />\nThe area of financial economics that deals with the study of real-world data is known as financial econometrics. Financial econometrics is concerned with the statistical analysis of financial data and testing the real-world applicability of asset-pricing theories. This major provides students with a thorough understanding of the economic principles that underlie the pricing and allocative role of all financial assets, whether they are stocks, bonds, futures or options.</p>\n", "keywords": ["economics", "commerce", "financial economics"], "implementationYear": 2021, "urlMap": "/undergraduate/specialisations/2021/ECONJ1", "studyLevel": "Undergraduate", "curriculumStructure": [{"title": "Prescribed Electives", "description": "Students must take at least 6 UOC of the following courses.", "creditPoints": 6, "relationships": [{"name": "Economics of Health and Human Capital", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ECON3125", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ECON3125", "order": 1200}, {"name": "Retirement Saving and Spending Over the Lifecycle", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ACTL3192", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ACTL3192", "order": 100}, {"name": "Behavioural Economics", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ECON3124", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ECON3124", "order": 1100}, {"name": "International Trade Theory and Policy", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ECON3116", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ECON3116", "order": 700}, {"name": "International Macroeconomics", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ECON3104", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ECON3104", "order": 300}, {"name": "Superannuation and Retirement Benefits", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ACTL3191", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ACTL3191", "order": 0}, {"name": "Development Economics", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ECON3110", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ECON3110", "order": 600}, {"name": "Statistics for Econometrics", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ECON3209", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ECON3209", "order": 1700}, {"name": "Real Estate Economics and Public Policy", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ECON3130", "url": "", "order": 1300}, {"name": "Mathematical Economics", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ECON3202", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ECON3202", "order": 1400}, {"name": "Economic Growth, Technology and Structural Change", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ECON3109", "url": "", "order": 500}, {"name": "Organisational Economics", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ECON3123", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ECON3123", "order": 1000}, {"name": "Applied Econometric Methods", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ECON3208", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ECON3208", "order": 1600}, {"name": "Political Economy of Capitalism", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ECON3119", "url": "", "order": 800}, {"name": "Politics and Economics", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ECON3106", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ECON3106", "order": 400}, {"name": "Econometric Theory and Methods", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ECON3203", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ECON3203", "order": 1500}, {"name": "Markets and Frictions", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ECON3101", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ECON3101", "order": 200}, {"name": "Industrial Organisation", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "ECON3121", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/ECON3121", "order": 900}], "children": [], "order": 200}, {"title": "Core Courses List A", "description": "Students must complete 36 UOC of List A core courses. <br /><br />Please note: Students completing a second major in Mathematics or statistics or in the following combined programs: Economics/Actuarial Studies, Economics/Adv Math (Hons), Economics/Science and Economics/Adv Science (Hons).

They study cultures, communities, societies and literature in France and the Francophone world. The French language plays a key role in expressing the cultures and identities of the places in which it is spoken. Learning French will provide students with a privileged form of access to the cultural resources and complex patterns of life in other countries. Developing competence in French will have an important place in promoting relationships and mutual understanding between countries and peoples.</p>\n\n<p>There are two main components of language study. The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the target language. Acquiring target language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending other people&#39;s expression, both oral and written. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the French language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform understanding of French and Francophone cultures. These disciplines include linguistic, literary, cultural, historical and social productions. Via the study of the French language and associated disciplines, we aim:</p>\n\n<ol><li>to foster understanding of the experiences and world-views of French and Francophone cultures;</li><li>to develop informed understanding of human experiences, cultures, and societies where French is spoken;</li><li>to enable students to place contemporary Australian society and culture in an historical and comparative context vis-\u00e0\u00a0-vis French and Francophone societies and cultures;</li><li>to develop the skills of critical, creative, and imaginative thinking about French and Francophone societies, cultures, and the arts;</li><li>to promote the techniques and value of reasoned and open-minded discussion and debate.</li></ol>\n\n<p>This stream is available to students commencing at Introductory and Intermediate entry levels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Placement Information</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students who wish to enrol in a language course without completing the necessary prerequisites are required to complete an online placement application form before the commencement of the term.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, please see the\u00a0<a href=\"http://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">School Website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For students admitted in their first year of study to ARTS2480 or higher on the grounds of ability and/or previous study, such courses will be counted as Level 1 courses in terms of degree requirements.</p>\n", "keywords": ["french"], "implementationYear": 2021, "urlMap": "/undergraduate/specialisations/2021/FRENA1", "studyLevel": "Undergraduate", "curriculumStructure": [{"title": "Contextual Studies Courses", "description": "You must take at least 12 UOC of the following courses.", "creditPoints": 0, "relationships": [{"name": "The Lives of the Impressionists and Other Artists", "description": "ARTS2484 -

Given this set of disciplinary skills, geographers are employed in a range of different professions, including urban management, regional planning, environmental assessment, advocacy and international development, and education.</p>\n<p>This\u00a0minor will provide you with a critical understanding of the human and physical basis of geography. Its offerings will provide you with diverse opportunities for field trips, conducting data analysis, engaging with policy debates and interrogating key sub-fields within the broader geographical discipline. The wide range of\u00a0courses on offer also means that you will be able to tailor your degree around broader themes such as \u2018development geographies\u2019, \u2018international geographies\u2019 \u2018geohumanities\u2019 the \u2018physical environment\u2019 and \u2018environmental geography\u2019.\u00a0</p>", "keywords": ["geography", "geographical studies", "human geography", "environment"], "implementationYear": 2021, "urlMap": "/undergraduate/specialisations/2021/GEOGL2", "studyLevel": "Undergraduate", "curriculumStructure": [{"title": "Level 1 Core Courses", "description": "Students must take 12 UOC of the following courses.", "creditPoints": 12, "relationships": [{"name": "Environmental Systems, Processes and Issues", "description": "GEOS1701 -

These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>", "keywords": ["geology", "earth science", "geoscience", "environmental science", "natural resource management"], "implementationYear": 2021, "urlMap": "/undergraduate/specialisations/2021/GEOLMH", "studyLevel": "Undergraduate", "curriculumStructure": [{"title": "Core Course", "description": "Students must take BEES4517 Biological, Earth and Environmental Science Honours three times for a total of 48 UOC.", "creditPoints": 48, "relationships": [{"name": "Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences Honours", "description": "BEES4517 - Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences Honours", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 16, "itemCode": "BEES4517", "url": "/undergraduate/courses/2021/BEES4517", "order": 1}], "children": [], "order": 1}], "structureSummary": "<p>Students must complete 48 UOC.</p>", "schoolName": "School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences", "facultyName": "Faculty of Science", "creditPoints": 48, "academicItemType": "Specialisation"}, {"code": "GERSBH", "title": "German Studies", "description": "The Honours program in German Studies requires the completion of 48 UOC (the equivalent of one year full-time study or two years part-time study).<br />\n<br />\nThe Honours program involves seminars and the completion of a research project or thesis.

Work by pure mathematicians underpins most of the technological advances of this century. Pure Mathematics is concerned with problems and techniques which transcend specific applications. Research, focusing on the development of existing theories or the creation of new ones, may be driven by applications or by the internal demands of the discipline. Pure Mathematics courses provide the insights and understanding required by those using mathematics, leading to mastery of the fundamental processes of mathematical science and the capacity for innovative applications in any area.</p>\n\n<p><em>Applied Mathematics</em> concerns the development of mathematics and models for understanding scientific phenomena, for the solution of technical and industrial problems, and for use in the social, economic and management sciences. Courses are designed to provide basic mathematical and computational skills needed for a wide range of applications, to develop the capability to construct, analyse and interpret mathematical models, and to encourage enthusiasm for the role of the mathematician in a variety of contexts.</p>\n\n<p><em>Statistics</em> is the science and art of using factual material for modelling and inference. Its mathematical foundations are in the theory of probability and it deals with how to estimate and make decisions using knowledge which is uncertain or observational material which is subject to error. There is a rich interplay of ideas between the theory of statistics and fields such as engineering, medicine and biological and behavioural sciences where statistical problems constantly arise.</p>\n\n<p>This stream is for a major in Mathematics for Education as part of a concurrent Bachelor of Science / Bachelor of Education program (4076).

The five core courses included as part of this stream have been designed on the basis of world best practice in manufacturing and industrial engineering and reflect a top-down - bottom-up approach, spanning the disciplines of Strategy and Management, Operations and Supply Chains, Analysis and Decision-making, Design of Product-Process Systems and Technology &amp; Automation.<br />\n<br />\nWithin each discipline area this new stream will cover many conceptual and analytical techniques, all supporting fact- and data-based analysis and decision making with the aim of improved product and process performance, economy and sustainability. This stream is designed to help you to learn how to transform a design from a conceptual stage into a prototype and ultimately into a commercially realisable and viable product. This stream focuses on technical as well as commercial aspects and particularly in developing the ability to build a business or commercial case for making engineering related decisions, such as investment in plant, equipment and processes. Although the main emphasis will be on product and process, consideration will also be given to designing compatible and appropriate engineering support services. The stream also emphasises the strategic impact of operations decisions and the interfaces between operations and the other functional areas of organisations, including of course, finance. This stream encompasses the key elements of operations management and investment analysis and pulls them together in a coherent format that allows you to understand the &#39;big picture&#39; as well as &#39;the specific details&#39;. It is aimed at integrating the knowledge gained from the mechanical engineering courses you have studied into a framework and process that allows you to implement your designs, solutions and ideas in a commercial environment.<br />\n<br />\nMechanical engineers have traditionally played the major role in the analysis and design of complex machinery, devices such as actuators and sensors, as well as energy transformation, heat transfer and electro-mechanical processes. In an environment of global competition, sustainability (energy, environment as well as cost and capital), increasingly complex customer requirements and statutory regulations as well as the increasing pace of technological change and new product innovation, it is vital for modern engineers to possess the skills to not only design but equally importantly, implement and realize their designs in the most appropriate way. In this increasingly complex environment, successful organizations - public, private or governmental - need engineers with analytical and diverse skills, especially in integrating technical with commercial and organisational issues, analyses and ultimately solutions. It is the purpose and aim of the Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering stream to equip you with this knowledge and understanding to become a global engineer, indeed a leader, with the ability to apply analytical methods and quality processes to create short and long term value for your organization, your customers, and the community. It encapsulates the key elements of mechanical engineering and combines them with the five core disciplines of manufacturing and industrial engineering.<br />\n<br />\nAn engineer trained in Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering may be employed in a very flexible and diverse range of disciplines and areas of industrial activity, including; product design, process design, computer aided design, computer aided manufacturing, quality improvement, technical and commercial analysis and decision making, strategic decision making, consulting, sales support, technical and organisational maintenance, and supply chain management.", "keywords": ["manufacturing engineering", "manufacturing", "mechanical", "engineer", "design", "engineering", "honours"], "implementationYear": 2021,

They turn the biological wheels on this globe and are responsible for sustainability of life.

Atomic-size systems behave according to quantum mechanics, which allows them to exhibit rather spectacular properties and dynamics. This stream trains students to design and operate devices that behave according to quantum mechanics, opening the possibility to exploit the peculiar laws of quantum physics to perform otherwise cumbersome or impossible tasks, such as the efficient solution of computationally hard problems, or the secure teleportation of information. Graduates from this stream will have valuable skills that position them ideally for the burgeoning quantum engineering industry, as well as broad skills across most key electrical engineering

The stream&#39;s professionalising pathway offers internships and arts reviewing courses which emphasise links to Sydney-based production companies, venues and publishing networks.
