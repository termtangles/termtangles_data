Professional doctorates do the same, but reflect health practice in the workplace and also incorporate real time, real work benefits for candidates and employers. Because your research focuses on your workplace, you receive the benefit of being able to integrate your studies into your day-to-day work.</p>\n\n<p>The UNSW Future Leaders Program provides an opportunity for strengthening health leadership capacity within the organization through you, the future leader. During this program you will have access to regular workshops, during which you will learn how to plan and undertake research and evaluation projects, skills which you will immediately put into use in your organisation. Research shows that staff members who feel engaged and supported are more likely to remain with their employers. So the benefits for you and your organisation are that you will develop your skills to a higher level and be able to directly contribute your growing expertise and experience to your organisation while you learn.

The length of the doctoral thesis is typically 50,000-60,000 words.
