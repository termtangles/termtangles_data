The development of e-enterprise systems must also take into consideration technological, managerial, and legal aspects.<br />\n<br />\nIn order to capitalise on opportunities in the emerging digital economy, organisations are re-inventing themselves as e-enterprises. More importantly, both business and government organisations need skilled IT professionals in e-commerce systems engineering to provide necessary IT support.<br />\n<br />\nThe e-Commerce Systems stream in the Graduate Diploma and Master of Information Technology programs exposes students to the foundations of e-Commerce systems and architectures, and to software engineering principles and techniques for building and managing such systems. The major also provides interdisciplinary background in the areas of e-Commerce management and policy, covering the legal aspect of e-Commerce, and effectively integrating all components in the development of e-enterprise systems.

You will rigorously, critically, and creatively engage with sociocultural and political-economic causes of, and responses to, today\u2019s human-inclusive environmental challenges. In addition to the program\u2019s key focus on conceptual tools, you will have the opportunity to develop an array of experiential and practical tools to inform ethical and restorative sustainability leadership in professional and change-making contexts. The program is structured around a transdisciplinary integration and bridging of social sciences, humanities, natural sciences, creative arts, and participatory community and place-based approaches. The experience of moving among diverse knowledge systems empowers you to communicate complex ideas, to nurture personal and collective societal capacities to rethink and reshape the world, and to partner with others in reparative and regenerative ways. With its flexible format, the program is suitable for people from a wide range of disciplines, including both environmental specialists and newcomers, seeking to develop the expertise and courage needed in environmental and societal healing and flourishing.</p>\n", "keywords": ["environmental policy and management", "environmental management", "environmental humanities", "environmental studies", "environmental policy", "sustainability"], "implementationYear": 2021, "urlMap": "/postgraduate/specialisations/2021/ENVPXS", "studyLevel": "Postgraduate", "curriculumStructure": [{"title": "Disciplinary Knowledge Courses", "description": "You must take at least 24 UOC of Disciplinary Knowledge Courses.<br /><br />If you complete 30 UOC of Disciplinary Knowledge Courses, then you are not required to complete a Prescribed Elective.", "creditPoints": 0, "relationships": [{"name": "Demystifying Environmental Law: From Regulation to Rights of Nature", "description": "IEST7200 -

The Master\u2019s program prepares our graduates to think in transformative ways and to become reflexive leaders, change-agents, and advocates at local and global scales. You will rigorously, critically, and creatively engage with sociocultural and political-economic causes of, and responses to, today\u2019s human-inclusive environmental challenges. In addition to the program\u2019s key focus on conceptual tools, you will have the opportunity to develop an array of experiential and practical tools to inform ethical and restorative sustainability leadership in professional and change-making contexts. The program is structured around a transdisciplinary integration and bridging of social sciences, humanities, natural sciences, creative arts, and participatory community and place-based approaches. The experience of moving among diverse knowledge systems empowers you to communicate complex ideas, to nurture personal and collective societal capacities to rethink and reshape the world, and to partner with others in reparative and regenerative ways. With its flexible format, the program is suitable for people from a wide range of disciplines, including both environmental specialists and newcomers, seeking to develop the expertise and courage needed in environmental and societal healing and flourishing.</p>\n<p>This program is primarily taught in Face-to-Face/Blended mode; with the exception of optional field-based courses, the program can

Established financial services firms (BigTech) and entrepreneurs (FinTech) both demand talent in this space as FinTech products are by nature scalable and have potential for huge impact in a financial services business.</p>\n<p>Co-developed with financial services industry experts, this specialisation introduces students to finance theory, financial products, markets, and institutions, then explores how big data and other technologies allow FinTech start-ups to cause consumers to shift away from traditional finance - fundamentally changing the way money is raised, transferred, stored, loaned, and invested around the world. In addition to a conceptual understanding of finance theory, financial markets, and financial services firms, students will experience FinTech courses via the Integrated Learning Laboratory (iLab). They will be able to gain personal access to financial market data platforms, handle financial market and unstructured data, learn how financial products work via the Python programming language, trade using the leading stock trading platform used by brokerage firms, and interact with practitioners.</p>\n<p>This specialisation in Financial Technology can be taken in the Master of Commerce or Master of Commerce (Extension).

Therefore, the petroleum specialisation requires the study of a range of courses that would allow a student from a non-Petroleum Engineering background to become competent working in a role that requires the direct application of Petroleum Engineering knowledge.</p>\n<p>Another characteristic of the oil &amp; gas industry is that the development and integration of new technology, as well as changes to the socio-political context of the industry, mean that Petroleum Engineers require deeper knowledge of the discipline combined with an understanding of how these innovations change the way Petroleum Engineering is practised. Therefore, the specialisation enables students from a Petroleum Engineering background to extend and broaden their knowledge of the discipline&#39;s context.</p>\n<p>Further, today&#39;s leaders in Petroleum Engineering need to be able to move from the existing body of knowledge in the profession to develop new and innovative solutions to problems covering the technical aspects of petroleum exploration and development, to project economics, and to the environmental and social context of the industry. Therefore, the stream includes a range of courses with a research or enquiry-based learning component. These enquiry-based components involve students solving an open-ended problem through the integration of taught material with their own investigation into the problem and developing their own solutions.</p>\n<p><strong>ENTRY REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>\n<p>Students need a recognised four year Bachelor degree in a relevant discipline of engineering.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "keywords":

to the stream requirements of the year you started.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Policymaking plays a key role in the management and change of the economy and society. Policy is part of every field of practice, which has led to a rapid growth in the need for policy professionals in government, business, and social and political organisations.</p>\n\n<p>The Master of Public Policy and Governance (MPPG) applies a social science perspective to questions of policy and management in modern organisations. You will acquire a solid grounding in policy analysis, policy evaluation and social research, the necessary skills and knowledge domains required for effective engagement within the policy process. You will be able to specialise in an area of direct relevance to your own interests, which may include Social Policy, International Development Policy or Policy Management.</p>\n\n<p>The program will prepare you for professional practice, by fostering analytical skills and a practical appreciation of the processes of policymaking, the significance of research and evidence in driving policy change and the role of stakeholders in effective policy implementation. The Master of Public Policy and Governance places emphasis on developing the skills and perspectives needed for proficient assessment, evaluation and sensitivity to the effectiveness of policy programs in terms of the impact they have on clients, customers and the public.</p>\n\n<p>Unique to the UNSW Master of Public Policy and Governance is the significant policy and research experience of the program&#39;s teaching staff. At UNSW, the staff involved in the MPPG have had direct experience either as policy makers or policy researchers in government, non-government organisations and, the business sectors. Combined, they have over 20 years direct experience working at high levels inside government, from providing policy support to the Council of Australian Governments through to conceptualising, designing and implementing large scale policy across the states. Staff are also actively involved with non-government organisations in providing effectively policy research and evidence to support their advocacy and lobbying activities. These teaching staff bring their real life experience to the classroom, revealing the relationship between theory, research and everyday practice.</p>\n\n<p>The Master of Public Policy and Governance aims to prepare you for work which requires analytical skills and a practical appreciation of the processes of policy-making and implementation. The program is oriented to the practice of policy, and prospective students are required to have relevant work experience. This may be in the public sector, unions, business or community organisations.</p>\n", "keywords": ["social research & policy program", "public policy and governance", "governance", "government", "policy", "public policy", "social policy"], "implementationYear": 2021, "urlMap": "/postgraduate/specialisations/2021/SRAPES", "studyLevel": "Postgraduate", "curriculumStructure": [{"title": "Admission Block Credit", "description": "If you are in program 8259 Public Policy & Governance you will have been issued 48 UOC Admission Block Credit.

Thus solutions to health problems often lie outside the health system - in social policy, urban design, community cohesion, personal relationships, and the penal system, to name but a few. The Master of Public Health stream in Social Research provides students with training in sociological conceptualisations of health and in approaches to health issues using both quantitative/epidemiological and qualitative/interpretive methods. It consists of core MPH courses, with a stream-defining course on sociological approaches to public health, two research methodology courses, and a selection of either an SPHCM elective, project, internship or independent studies. The stream is taught by staff with a broad range of disciplinary backgrounds including sociology, psychology, political science, anthropology, ethnography and epidemiology.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who should do this stream?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This MPH degree focuses on the social aspects of health and social approaches to addressing public health problems. You may be a social science graduate seeking training in public health research skills, or a public health or healthcare practitioner wanting to develop your understanding of social influences on health and illness.</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in carrying out research, the degree provides a clear pathway towards further academic research training (e.g. a PhD) or research in the workplace (government policy, program evaluation etc.). Graduates from this stream develop the knowledge and skills to enter postgraduate research degrees that require expertise in either social epidemiology or qualitative research, or both.</p>\n\n<p>This stream is for anyone who wants to change public health and health policy for the better - even when change means political action or social change outside the healthcare system. Much medical and health research does not make a difference, because it stays in the medical journals. This degree will equip you to see the social and structural problems that prevent useful policy change, and find ways to address them.</p>\n", "keywords": ["public health and community medicine", "social research", "public health", "social policy", "health policy", "qualitative research", "social studies of public health", "health sociology", "social science"], "implementationYear": 2021, "urlMap": "/postgraduate/specialisations/2021/PHCMVS", "studyLevel": "Postgraduate", "curriculumStructure": [{"title": "Specialisation Defining Courses", "description": "Students must take 6 UOC of the following courses.", "creditPoints": 6, "relationships": [{"name": "Politics, Surveillance and Public Health", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "PHCM9522", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/PHCM9522", "order": 0}], "children": [], "order": 0}, {"title": "Social Research Methodology Courses", "description": "Students must take 12 UOC of the following courses.<br />Note: *Students with appropriate background qualifications may choose only one of the methodology courses, with permission of the stream convenor, and elect to conduct a supervised research project on a social research-related topic or Internship by enrolling in either PHCM9143 Internship (6 UOC) or PHCM9148 Project 6 Units of Credit (6 UOC).", "creditPoints": 0, "relationships": [{"name": "Qualitative Research Methods", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "PHCM9120", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/PHCM9120", "order": 0}, {"name": "Applied Research Methods for Public Health", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "PHCM9132", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/PHCM9132", "order": 100}], "children": [], "order": 100}, {"title": "Project, Internship or Elective", "description": "Students must take one of the following: a 6 UOC postgraduate elective course offered by SPHCM, an internship, independent studies or a 6 UOC project in a topic related to social research. <br />any course matching the pattern: PHCM9### <br />PHCM9103 Independent Studies 6 OC<br />PHCM9143 Internship 6 UOC <br />PHCM9148 Minor Project 6 UOC", "creditPoints": 0, "relationships": [{"name": "Internship", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "PHCM9143", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/PHCM9143", "order": 100}, {"name": "Minor Project", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "PHCM9148", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/PHCM9148", "order": 200}, {"name": "Independent Study 6 Units of Credit", "description": "", "type": "Course", "creditPoints": 6, "itemCode": "PHCM9103", "url": "/postgraduate/courses/2021/PHCM9103", "order": 0}], "children": [], "order": 200}], "schoolName": "School of Public Health & Community Medicine", "facultyName": "Faculty of Medicine", "creditPoints": 24, "academicItemType": "Specialisation"}, {"code": "SLSPAS", "title": "Social Science and Policy", "description": "The Graduate Diploma in Arts by Research (program 5275) is offered by Schools and approved disciplinary programs in UNSW Arts and Social Sciences.
